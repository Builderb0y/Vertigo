find more vanilla packets being sent when they shouldn't be.

I think I only have a "vertigo installed" packet registered in one direction and not the other.
	register it in both directions.
	do this next time I need a packet protocol change.

mod compatibility:

changelog:
	* For mod developers: Fixed VertigoServerEvents.SECTION_UNLOADED firing after the unload packet is sent, when its contract clearly states that it should be fired before.

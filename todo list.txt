find more vanilla packets being sent when they shouldn't be.

I think I only have a "vertigo installed" packet registered in one direction and not the other.
	register it in both directions.
	do this next time I need a packet protocol change.

mod compatibility:

changelog:
	* Fixed race condition when changing dimensions or respawning causing chunks to successfully load initially, but future block updates to fail.
		* In particular, this bug meant that the player would not be able to interact with blocks until relogging.
	* Fixed potential issue syncing block updates when there's more than one player nearby on the server.

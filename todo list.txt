find more vanilla packets being sent when they shouldn't be.

I think I only have a "vertigo installed" packet registered in one direction and not the other.
	register it in both directions.
	do this next time I need a packet protocol change.

mod compatibility:

changelog:
	* Fixed compatibility with ScalableLux, Valkyrien Skies, and AntiXray.
	* Marked 1.21.3 version as also being compatible with 1.21.2 (un-tested, use at your own risk).
	* Ditto for 1.20.6 -> 1.20.5 and 1.20.4 -> 1.20.3.
	For mod developers:
	* Added a new API method to query whether a player is tracking sections or chunks.
		* In singleplayer, this always returns true.
		* In multiplayer, this only returns true if the other side has a version of Vertigo installed which has a compatible packet protocol.

find more vanilla packets being sent when they shouldn't be.

I think I only have a "vertigo installed" packet registered in one direction and not the other.

	do this next time I need a packet protocol change.

mod compatibility:

changelog:
	* Fixed crash that could happen when changing dimensions in very specific ways.
	* Marked 1.20.1 jar as also compatible with 1.20.0.

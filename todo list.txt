find more vanilla packets being sent when they shouldn't be.

I think I only have a "vertigo installed" packet registered in one direction and not the other.
	register it in both directions.
	do this next time I need a packet protocol change.

mod compatibility:

changelog:
* Switch to vanilla method of removing block entities. Maybe this will fix an issue that shouldn't ever happen to begin with?

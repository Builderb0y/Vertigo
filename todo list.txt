find more vanilla packets being sent when they shouldn't be.

additional API hook to query if a player is tracking sections or chunks.
mark some versions as compatible with other MC versions.
	1.21.3 should also be compatible with 1.21.2, for example.
I think I only have a "vertigo installed" packet registered in one direction and not the other.
	register it in both directions.

mod compatibility:
	valkyrien skies: need to force shipyard chunks to be synced fully.
		they should be mostly empty though, so hopefully this is ok.

changelog:
	* Fixed compatibility with ScalableLux.
	* Fixed compatibility with AntiXray.

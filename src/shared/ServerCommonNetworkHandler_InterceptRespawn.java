/**
{@link ServerEntityWorldChangeEvents#AFTER_PLAYER_CHANGE_WORLD}
fires after all the chunks have been sent, but I need to be
notified before this happens so that old chunks can be
cleared from the tracker BEFORE new chunks are added to it.

there are 3 different code paths in vanilla which
are used when a player changes dimensions,
but one thing they have in common is that all
3 of them send a {@link PlayerRespawnS2CPacket}.
so, that's what I handle here.
